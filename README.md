Astrocalc is a simple pythong tool to identify the time of sunrise and sunset at a given location based on the calculations found in
the Almanac for computers, 1990. Author:	United States Naval Observatory. Nautical Almanac Office.

It isn't intended to be used for anything mission critical but as a simple tool that can be used to refer to sunrise and sunset times so I can plan photography shots around.
Further work needs to be done to account for latitudes closer to the poles, and to account for observers at altitudes that are not sea level.
